presenting the work of the Belfast Group poets


-----

This fork of https://github.com/emory-libraries-beckctr/belfast was created for TEI XML enhancement work being done 
as part of the `Digital Scholarship Commons`_ project `Networking the Belfast Group`_.

.. _Digital Scholarship Commons: http://disc.library.emory.edu/
.. _Networking the Belfast Group: http://web.library.emory.edu/disc/projects/networking-belfast-group

Project contributors should create a branch for the XML file they are working on, tag names and link to 
appropriate authority record URIs (VIAF, GeoNames.org, DBpedia), and commit to the appropriate branch.  When 
the names are tagged, issue a pull request from the branch for that XML file to the original Beck Center belfast
repository for review and eventual inclusion.  Any feedback or changes required after review from Beck Center staff 
should be made on that branch.
