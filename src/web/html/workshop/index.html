        Group meetings in the 1967-1968 year (Michael Allen to ____, 4 Oct. 1968, 
        Irish Literary Miscellany, Robert W. Woodruff Library, Emory University) 
        , followed by a full year interruption in 1970-1971 while Heaney was at 
        the University of California at Berkeley. The Group finally ceased meeting 
        altogether during the 1971-1972 school year. <br>
